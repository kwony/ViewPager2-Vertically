# ViewPager2-Vertically

Vertical View Pager2 bug report. 

- Next fragment item is created automatically when soft keyboard is shown. You can notice it on toast message. Fragment adapted on vertical viewpager show toast message when its view is created
- When I touch text editor, it lost its focus until I touch it again. It behaves differently depending on device and platform version
- I test it on GALAXY Note10 with Android P.
